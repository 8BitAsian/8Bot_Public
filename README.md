# 8Bot_Public
Public repo of 8Bot for Discord, for sharing purposes. The main purpose of this super simple bot was to get familiar with the Discord API, Discord message I/O handling, OAuth2 verification, and bot account integration. Please ignore the somewhat sloppy and lazy arrays!

Also helped me learn a lot about webhosting on AWS and Heroku instances as an added bonus!
